## 5. Coding Standards

### TypeScript Best Practices

Nexus uses TypeScript for all code. Follow these guidelines:

1. **Type Safety**: Prioritize type safety over convenience. Avoid using `any` when more specific types can be used.

2. **Interfaces and Types**: Use interfaces for object shapes and types for unions, primitives, and tuples.

3. **Descriptive Names**: Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and types.

4. **Functional Approach**: Prefer pure functions and immutable data structures when appropriate.

5. **Error Handling**: Use explicit error handling rather than silent failures.

6. **Async/Await**: Use async/await for asynchronous code instead of raw promises.

7. **Explicit Returns**: Include explicit return types for functions, especially exported ones.

Example of good practice:

```typescript
interface HttpRequestOptions {
  url: string;
  method: 'GET' | 'POST' | 'PUT' | 'DELETE';
  headers?: Record<string, string>;
  timeout?: number;
}

async function makeHttpRequest<T>(options: HttpRequestOptions): Promise<T> {
  try {
    // Implementation details...
    return result as T;
  } catch (error) {
    // Error handling...
    throw new Error(`Request failed: ${error.message}`);
  }
}
```

### Code Formatting

Nexus uses ESLint and Prettier for code formatting. The configuration files are included in the repository.

1. **Automatic Formatting**: Configure your editor to use Prettier with the project settings.

2. **Linting**: Run ESLint before submitting your code:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

3. **VS Code Setup**: If using VS Code, install the ESLint and Prettier extensions and configure them to format on save.

4. **Pre-commit Hook**: A pre-commit hook is configured to run linting and formatting automatically.

### Testing Requirements

All code contributions must include appropriate tests:

1. **Unit Tests**: Individual functions and components should have unit tests.

2. **Integration Tests**: Features that interact with other components should have integration tests.

3. **Test Coverage**: Aim for at least 80% test coverage for new code.

4. **Test Framework**: We use Jest for testing. Run tests with:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

5. **Test Structure**: Tests should be placed in a `__tests__` directory adjacent to the code being tested.

Example test structure:

```
nodes/OpenAIExtended/
├── OpenAIExtended.node.ts
└── __tests__/
    ├── OpenAIExtended.test.ts
    └── fixtures/
        └── testData.json
```

### Documentation Requirements

All code contributions should include appropriate documentation:

1. **Code Comments**: Use JSDoc-style comments for functions, classes, and interfaces.

2. **README Updates**: Update README files when adding or modifying features.

3. **Implementation Examples**: Provide usage examples for new features.

4. **Inline Documentation**: Complex code sections should have inline comments explaining the logic.

Example of good documentation:

```typescript
/**
 * Makes an HTTP request with specified options.
 * 
 * @param options - The request configuration options
 * @returns Promise containing the response data
 * @throws Error if the request fails
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const data = await makeHttpRequest<UserData>({
 *   url: 'https://api.example.com/users',
 *   method: 'GET',
 *   timeout: 5000
 * });
 * ```
 */
async function makeHttpRequest<T>(options: HttpRequestOptions): Promise<T> {
  // Implementation...
}
```

---

## 6. Custom Node Development

Custom nodes are a core component of the Nexus framework. Follow these guidelines when developing new nodes:

### Node Structure

Each custom node should follow this structure:

```
nodes/NodeName/
├── NodeName.node.ts       # Main node implementation
├── NodeName.svg           # Node icon (SVG format)
├── README.md              # Node documentation
└── __tests__/            # Test directory
    └── NodeName.test.ts  # Tests for the node
```

The main node file should implement the `INodeType` interface from n8n:

```typescript
import {
  IExecuteFunctions,
  INodeExecutionData,
  INodeType,
  INodeTypeDescription,
} from 'n8n-workflow';

export class NodeName implements INodeType {
  description: INodeTypeDescription = {
    // Node description...
  };

  async execute(this: IExecuteFunctions): Promise<INodeExecutionData[][]> {
    // Node execution logic...
  }
}
```

### Node Functionality Guidelines

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each node should have a clear, focused purpose.

2. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling with informative error messages.

3. **Resource Management**: Properly manage resources like API connections and file handles.

4. **Credential Security**: Use the n8n credential system for sensitive information.

5. **Parameter Validation**: Validate input parameters before processing.

6. **Output Consistency**: Maintain consistent output formats for predictable workflow behavior.

7. **Performance Optimization**: Implement efficiency techniques for resource-intensive operations.

### UI/UX Principles

1. **Intuitive Parameters**: Organize node parameters in a logical, intuitive manner.

2. **Descriptive Labels**: Use clear labels and descriptions for all parameters.

3. **Default Values**: Provide sensible default values where appropriate.

4. **Conditional Display**: Use display conditions to show parameters only when relevant.

5. **Input Help**: Provide examples and guidance in parameter descriptions.

Example of good parameter definition:

```typescript
{
  displayName: 'Operation',
  name: 'operation',
  type: 'options',
  default: 'completion',
  description: 'The operation to perform',
  options: [
    {
      name: 'Text Completion',
      value: 'completion',
      description: 'Generate text from a prompt',
    },
    {
      name: 'Embeddings',
      value: 'embeddings',
      description: 'Create embeddings for text analysis',
    },
  ],
}
```

### Testing & Validation

1. **Comprehensive Testing**: Test all operations and parameter combinations.

2. **Edge Cases**: Include tests for edge cases and error scenarios.

3. **Mocking External Services**: Use mocks for external services like APIs.

4. **Local Validation**: Test nodes with the local n8n instance before submitting.

5. **Integration Testing**: Verify the node works correctly within workflows.

```typescript
// Example test for an OpenAI node
describe('OpenAIExtended Node', () => {
  let workflow: Workflow;
  let workflowExecute: WorkflowExecute;
  
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Set up workflow and mock OpenAI API...
  });
  
  it('should correctly perform text completion', async () => {
    // Test implementation...
    expect(result[0].json.text).toContain('Expected response');
  });
  
  it('should handle API errors gracefully', async () => {
    // Test error handling...
    expect(executionData.errors).toHaveLength(1);
    expect(executionData.errors[0].message).toContain('API Error');
  });
});
```

---

## 7. Workflow Template Contributions

Workflow templates are production-ready examples that demonstrate the capabilities of the Nexus framework.

### Template Requirements

1. **Complete Functionality**: Workflows should be fully functional end-to-end.

2. **Production-Ready**: Include error handling, input validation, and documentation.

3. **Well-Structured**: Organize workflows with clear naming and logical flow.

4. **Generically Applicable**: Templates should be adaptable to different contexts.

5. **Security Conscious**: Avoid hardcoded credentials or sensitive information.

### Documentation Standards

Each workflow template should include:

1. **README.md**: A dedicated documentation file explaining:
   - Purpose and use case
   - Required credentials and setup
   - Configuration options
   - Example inputs and outputs
   - Customization guidance

2. **Internal Documentation**:
   - Node descriptions explaining their purpose
   - Comments on complex logic or decisions
   - Explanations for non-obvious configurations

3. **Workflow Metadata**:
   - Tags for categorization
   - Version information
   - Author attribution

Example README structure for a workflow template:

```markdown

## Configuring the OpenAI Node

To use the OpenAI node in your workflow, you need to configure the API access and operation parameters.

### Setting Up API Access

1. Create an API key in your OpenAI account dashboard
2. Add a new credential in n8n of type 'OpenAI API'
3. Enter your API key and save the credential

### Configuring Text Completion

The text completion operation generates text based on a provided prompt:

```typescript
// Example: Basic text completion configuration
{
  "operation": "completion",
  "model": "text-davinci-003",
  "prompt": "Write a product description for a smart water bottle",
  "maxTokens": 150,
  "temperature": 0.7
}
```

The `temperature` parameter controls randomness: lower values (e.g., 0.2) produce more focused outputs, while higher values (e.g., 0.8) produce more creative outputs.
```
